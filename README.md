# Become a Software Porfessional 2023
## Week 01
We worked on de figma design to develop the webpage for a gym. It was built in a desktop size. We finished all the pages and functionalities that we were asked to do.
## Week 02
This week I worked on the .html of the landing page of the figma design. I started with a menu that links the user to different pages, such as the sign in page and the info section. Then, I placed the "welcome" messege to the gym followed by a list of options that the user will have.
Then I added a form to make suggestions. There is a little piece of the history of the place that I added after the form.
I made lists to show the different activities that the gym offers, and the types of memberships that they have. 
And for the footer I added the copyright text and the logos of the social media.
